# GeyserFloatingPoints
Workaround to fix floating-point precision on Bedrock when at high coordinate.

## How this works
- Simply works by spoofing position on Bedrock player side, making it seems like they're still close to 0 0 0 coordinate.

## Commands
- `/geyserfloatingpoints position` - Toggle on/off actionbar that show your real position. Permission: `geyserfloatingpoints.position`

## Drawbacks
- You won't be able to see your real position since your position is always spoofed.
- Bugs are bound to happened, feel free to report ems :)
